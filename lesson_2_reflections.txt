What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

1) A hidden .git directory is created.
	1-a) contains the meta-data for the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

1) I'm not sure? if I were to change the contents of a file that was staged would the original in the working directory change too? if not then it's an obvious benefit - if it does I see no reason for the staging area to exist.
2) If it is a temp area for possible commits that are not yet fully tested you could add/remove files depending on test results.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

1) git diff without arguments will show the differences between working and staging
2) git diff --staged shows differences between staged and latest commit
