When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

1). a remote would be good if you are working on a project from multiple locations or computers
2). also if you are working with other developers on the same project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

1). if other team members are working on branches that may or may not be part of the final product you wont want to see them
2). depending on your location, connectivity and size of data transfer you may not necessarily  want to perform a large pull
